> **Attention:** Currently under construction, heavy development, and in an early stage.
This project was restarted from scratch. Switch to the 'prototype' branch to get the most out of it.

I embarked on this journey to create Ultra Spectra, a dynamic game engine framework. My motivation? Simple – it's immensely enjoyable, and coding is my passion.

Now, let's address the elephant in the room: am I reinventing the wheel? Look around the market – each day, a "new" solution emerges for age-old problems.

## Crafting the Foundation

Supported Development Environments:
- Visual Studio 2022 >v17.7

### For VS2022 Enthusiasts
1. Run 'prepare.bat' to build the Visual Studio solution.
2. In your developer console, execute 'msbuild'.

## Aspirations

While this project has educational roots, it also holds the promise of intrigue. My goals include:
- Creating a versatile game engine framework compatible across platforms and APIs
- Crafting an intuitive game editor catering to diverse needs
- Not a rival to Unity, Unreal, and their ilk, but a sidekick for "have-fun" projects

## Features at a Glance

> **Note:** Windows is the central development platform. As such, it'll be the initial recipient of all the goodies.

Features are my canvas. For the rest, I wield libraries like any other creator.

### @Work
Everything revolving around the application and its renderer.

### On the Horizon
Expect a slew of surprises until my satisfaction knows no bounds!

# Legalities

Several [third-party](3rd-Party/3rd-Party.md "3rd-Party") libraries power this project.

Let's embrace the future of gaming together! 🎮🌟🚀
Bitte lass mich wissen, wenn noch weitere Anpassungen nötig sind!
